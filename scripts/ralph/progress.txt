Variant: [nextjs/supabase | nextjs/convex | sveltekit/supabase | sveltekit/convex]

## Codebase Patterns
- All utilities in src/lib/ (never src/utils/)
- Use const service pattern for services
- Supabase: server client in server actions, browser client in components
- Convex: use useQuery/useMutation hooks in components
- Delete unused code immediately

## Key Files
- .claude/common-mistakes.md - read before coding
- .claude/docs/patterns.md - const service pattern
- src/lib/ - all utilities here
